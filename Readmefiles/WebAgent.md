## Agent Overview

The Web Agent plays a crucial role in the News Agent project, where it receives news data from the Console Display Agent and renders it on a web page. Users can access the latest news articles conveniently through a web interface, making it accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Features

### Web-Based News Display
- News articles are displayed on a web page, making them easily accessible through a web browser.

### Real-time Updates
- The agent continuously receives news data and updates the web page with the latest articles without the need for manual refreshing.

### Customizable Display
- The appearance and structure of the web page can be customized to match the desired look and feel.

## Getting Started

To use the Web Agent, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. Set up the agent by creating a Flask web application and defining routes for receiving data and rendering the web page.

3. Customize the web page's HTML and CSS to achieve the desired appearance and structure.

## Usage

The Web Agent works in conjunction with the Console Display Agent. It receives news articles from the console agent and renders them on a web page. Users can access the web page to read the latest news articles conveniently.

## Configuration

The key configurations for the Web Agent include:

- `@app.route("/receive_data", methods=["POST"])`: Defines the route for receiving news data via POST requests.

- `@app.route("/")`: Defines the route for rendering the web page.

- Customization of the web page's HTML and CSS to control its appearance.

## Example Usage

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

received_data = []

@app.route("/receive_data", methods=["POST"])
def receive_data():
    data = request.json
    received_data.append(data)
    return jsonify({"success": True})

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html", data=received_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=8002)  
```
